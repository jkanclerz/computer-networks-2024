## Operating system in a networked environment

### Tasks


1. Using a virtual machine, install the OS and list the IP configuration parameters i.e:
   * Address
   * Netmask
   * Gateway address
   * DNS 1
   * DNS 2
    
   Obtain the above parameters on all of the following systems

   * [Linux Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org/)
   * [Linux Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
   * Windows 

2. Check and prepare the characteristics for a sample device in your home network
   * Address
   * Netmask
   * Gateway address
   * DNS 1
   * DNS 2
  
   Prepare graphic documentation of example home network, including addresses and devices

3. Register a CISCO Academy account to download Packet tracer

### Virtualization network types

Test the network parameters for the different types supported by your software. annotate each configuration with comments about functionality. 
* connection to internet Yes / No
* Connection to other virtual machines Yes / No
* Connection to host computer Yes / No
* connection to other devices on the Host's network Yes / No
